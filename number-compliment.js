/* NUMBER COMPLIMENT ***********************************************************
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy
is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed
integer.

You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.

Example 1:
- Input: 5
- Output: 2

Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and
its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

Example 2:
- Input: 1
- Output: 0

Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and
its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
